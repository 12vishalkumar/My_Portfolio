## Key Features  

### 1. Responsive Navigation

### 2. Profile Section  
- A dedicated introduction area with a profile image, a professional tagline, and two call-to-action buttons: one for downloading the resume and another for quick navigation to contact details.

### 3. About Section

### 5. Projects Section

## Design and Styling  

- **Typography**: A modern sans-serif font is used for clarity and professionalism.  
- **Color Palette**: Subtle greys and black for text and borders, with white backgrounds to keep a clean and minimal aesthetic.  
- **Layout**: Sections are vertically stacked, with consistent spacing and alignment. Containers use rounded corners and soft borders for a polished look.  
- **Buttons**: Rounded buttons with hover effects that invert colors, adding interactivity and visual feedback.  
- **Icons**: Custom icons are used for skills, social media, and contact information to improve user experience.  

## Responsiveness  

The site is optimized for multiple screen sizes using **media queries**:  

- **Large Screens (1400px and below)**: Adjusts section heights and enables flexible wrapping in layout containers.  
- **Medium Screens (1200px and below)**: Switches from desktop navigation to hamburger menu. Section layouts are adjusted to stack vertically instead of side-by-side.  
- **Small Screens (600px and below)**: Further scales down typography and icons, adjusts section heights, and makes layouts fully vertical for mobile friendliness. Navigation links and buttons are restructured for touch usability.  

## Interactivity  

- A JavaScript toggle function enables the hamburger menu to expand and collapse.  
- Buttons and links are interactive with hover effects.  
- Smooth scrolling is enabled for in-page navigation.  

## Use Cases  

- A personal branding website for students, developers, or professionals looking to showcase their portfolio.  
- Can be extended with more project cards, blog sections, or additional pages.  
- Serves as a lightweight, easy-to-maintain online resume and portfolio.  

## Future Enhancements  

- Adding animations for section transitions.  
- Integrating a contact form with backend support (e.g., using email API).  
- Expanding the Projects section with more detailed descriptions.  
- Optimizing accessibility features like ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
